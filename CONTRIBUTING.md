## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[CONTRIBUTING.md Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
via filing a [GitHub Issue](/issues/new).

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available documentation on the [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you can reproduce the issue on [findingatime.com](https://findingatime.com) or are using the latest version locally.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using unsupported browsers
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback) or Console Log error message
  - Browser, OS and Platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?
